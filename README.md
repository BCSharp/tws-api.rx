# TWS-API wrapped in Reactived Extensions

This is a wrapper to the TWS-API library using [Reactive Extensions][1]. TWS-API is developed by
Interactive Brokers on GitHub in a [private repository][2]. The TWS-API.Rx wrapper will not 
be usable without it. To join TWS-API development and gain access to the source code see
their [public repository][3].

The library here uses git submodules to pull the tested commit of TWS-API so a read-only access
to the TWS-API would be helpful.
